# Place this file in the root of this app, or ~/.robo/robo.yml.

dump:
  # mysqldump, pg_dump, sqlite3, or mongodump
  type: 'mysqldump'
  # Where credentials are stored: 'env', or 'file'.
  strategy: 'env'
  # When the strategy is 'file' the "credentials_file" property must exist.
  # This file is expected to be in format similar to .env or .ini files.
  ## Example:
  # DATABASE=my-database-name
  # USERNAME=root
  # PASSWORD=123456abcdef
  credentials_file: '/home/some-user/credentials.txt'
  ## Example:  credentials_file: '/home/some-user/some.ini'
  ## Example:  credentials_file: '/home/some-user/.env'

  # The "credentials" property must exist for any strategy.
  # 'env'  - The credentials should be the names of the environment variables where the values are stored.
  #          If the value is not found as an environment variable, then the value will be treated as the literal credential.
  # 'file' - Like 'env', the credentials should be the names of the variables within the credential files.
  #          If the value is not found in the file, then the value will be treated as the literal credential.
